This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below...

Player must unlock the jewelry box from the bedroom with the key from the study, and take the lens from inside. They must also take gears from the drawer in the foyer and find all three crystals (green, blue, and purple). The green is in the lab, the blue is in the cave, and the purple is in the Underground Spring, and the path to there can only be seen if you are wearing the spectacles from the study when you look around the cave.

Only when all three crystals are in the machine with the new lens and gears does the machine begin to work and the player wins the game.

There are additional things you can do to uncover the story behind the game. But these are not required to win. If you read what can be read, the picture should be fairly clear. 

(FURTHER SPOILERS) 
If you say the word abracadabra while in the study, the mirror will play back what happened to the wizard.

# LAYOUT

The map is as follows, rooms are laid out in a chain, with the greenhouse at the top, the lab just below, the study below that, the bedroom below that, the foyer below that, the cave below that, and then an additional underground spring room to the north of the cave.
